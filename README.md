Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a part-time virtual assistant with a background in food technology and now aspiring SEO. This repo is where I share resources, projects, and insights from my tech career journey.

For those looking to learn or advance in tech, I recommend checking out Yellow Tail Tech wherein I found as great resources and certifications.
